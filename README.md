   - Upload your professional photo to the AI chat
   - Ask the AI to encode it as a base64 image or use the file URL in the template
   - Alternatively, tell the AI where you'll place the image file (e.g., "My photo will be named 'profile.jpg' in the same folder")

## Customization Tips

- **Photo**: You have several options for adding your photo:
  - Replace `profile-placeholder.jpg` with your own photo (keep the same filename)
  - Update the image path in the HTML if using a different filename
  - If working with AI, you can upload your photo directly to the AI and ask it to include it in the template
  - For Claude or GPT-4 with Vision, you can have the AI encode your photo as a base64 string directly in the HTML
- **Colors**: Modify the CSS variables to match your personal brand.
- **Sections**: Add or remove sections based on your needs.
- **Icons**: You can change the icons using Font Awesome classes.
- **Language**: Create your resume in any language by asking AI to translate the template:
  ```
  Please translate all text in this resume template to [YOUR LANGUAGE] while preserving 
  the HTML structure and styling. Keep technical terms and HTML/CSS/JavaScript code intact.
  ```

## Example AI Prompt

Here's an example prompt you can use with ChatGPT or Claude:
